# Shell commands with multiline definitions and/or positional arguments and/or
# quotes do not work in Windows. For anything but the simplest shell commands,
# it is recommended to create separate script files and simply call them here
# in commands or mappings.
#
# Also, the default keybindings are defined using cmd syntax (i.e. '%EDITOR%')
# which does not work with powershell. Therefore, you need to override these
# keybindings with explicit choices accordingly.

# change the editor used in default editor keybinding
# There is no builtin terminal editor installed in Windows. The default editor
# mapping uses 'notepad' which launches in a separate GUI window. You may
# instead install a terminal editor of your choice and replace the default
# editor keybinding accordingly.
